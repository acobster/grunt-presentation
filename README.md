# Automating your development workflow with Grunt

Reveal.js slideshow expounding the benefits of Grunt. Based on reveal's grunt-init branch and managed with Grunt, of course.

## Installation

The **basic setup** is for authoring presentations only. The **full setup** gives you access to all reveal.js features as well as the development tasks needed to make changes to the source.

### Basic setup


1. Download this repo as a .zip

3. Open index.html in a browser to view it


### Full setup

Some reveal.js features, like external markdown, require that presentations run from a local web server. The following instructions will set up such a server as well as all of the development tasks needed to make edits to the reveal.js source code.

1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)

2. Install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started#installing-the-cli)

4. Clone the reveal.js repository  
```
$ git clone git@github.com:acobster/grunt-presentation.git
```

5. Install dependencies  
```
$ npm install
```

6. Serve the presentation and monitor source files for changes  
```
$ grunt serve
```

7. Open <http://localhost:8000> to view your presentation
